        <div class ="fs1" id="fs2"><u>The Lemon Shark!</u><div class="fs1" id="fs3">The lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) is a yellow-skinned species found in shallow subtropical waters. Classified as Vulnerable, it grows up to 3.4 meters and often returns to the same nursery sites to breed. Lemon sharks are nocturnal hunters, using electroreceptors to locate fish. They benefit from group living and have a biennial reproductive cycle, giving birth to live young. Though capable of biting, they pose little threat to humans. Their average lifespan is 25–30 years, with the oldest known one living to 40 in captivity. Lemon sharks may show territorial or possessive behavior, especially around divers they've bonded with. They sometimes prefer certain individuals and may react negatively if those divers interact with other sharks, even trying to push the others away.</div></div>

        <div class ="ss1" id="ss2"><u>The Whale Shark!</u><div class="ss1" id="ss3">The whale shark is the largest fish in the world, growing up to 12 meters or more. Despite its size, it is a gentle giant, feeding mainly on plankton, small fish, and shrimp by filter-feeding. Whale sharks have a distinctive look with white spots and stripes across their dark bodies. They live in warm, tropical oceans and are harmless to humans.Whale sharks are known for their calm and curious nature around humans. In areas where they are regularly seen, they often tolerate the presence of divers and snorkelers, sometimes even approaching them out of curiosity. However, they should be treated with respect and space, as touching or disturbing them can cause stress or harm. Sadly, they are listed as Endangered due to threats like fishing, boat strikes, and habitat loss.</div></div>

With its streamlined body, sharp teeth, and strong senses, it hunts seals, fish, and other marine animals. Great whites are found in coastal and open temperate waters worldwide.Though often feared, attacks on humans are rare and usually due to mistaken identity. In reality, great whites are often curious but cautious. They may approach divers or boats, especially during cage diving, but usually avoid contact. Divers must still treat them with caution and respect.Listed as Vulnerable, great whites face threats from overfishing, bycatch, and illegal hunting.</div></div>

        <div class ="ffs1" id="ffs2"><u>The Hammerhead Shark!</u><div class="ffs1" id="ffs3">The hammerhead shark is known for its unique, wide T-shaped head, which gives it excellent vision and the ability to better detect prey like fish, rays, and squid. They live in warm, tropical and temperate waters, often seen near coastlines or reefs, and some species can grow over 6 meters long.Hammerheads are generally shy and non-aggressive toward humans. While they may approach divers out of curiosity, they usually keep their distance and rarely pose a threat. Divers sometimes spot large groups of hammerheads, especially during seasonal migrations or near seamounts.Hammerhead sharks are listed as Critically Endangered or Vulnerable, depending on the species, due to overfishing and the shark fin trade.</div></div>
